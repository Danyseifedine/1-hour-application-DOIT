# Todo Application

## Overview

This project is a unique take on the traditional todo list application. It allows users to create todos, which can then be interacted with by other users through comments and images. The application is designed to facilitate collaboration and communication around tasks, making it more than just a simple list.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to manage their todos.
- **Create Todos**: Users can add new todos with a title and description.
- **Commenting System**: Other users can add comments to each todo, providing feedback or additional information. The publisher of the todo has the ability to approve comments.
- **Image Upload**: Users can attach images to their comments, enhancing the context of their feedback.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The application uses Axios to handle asynchronous requests, ensuring that todos, comments, and images are updated in real-time without needing to refresh the page.

## How It Works

1. **Creating a Todo**: Users can create a todo by filling out a form with a title and description. Once submitted, the todo is saved to the database.
2. **Adding Comments**: Other users can view the todo and add comments. Each comment can include text and an optional image. The publisher of the todo can approve or reject comments.
3. **Real-Time Interaction**: Using Axios, the application sends requests to the server to fetch and display new comments and images as they are added, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: The backend framework for handling requests and managing the database.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.
- **MySQL**: The database used to store todos, comments, and user information.

## Conclusion

This todo application not only helps users manage their tasks but also encourages collaboration through comments and images. The real-time functionality enhances user engagement, making it a dynamic tool for productivity and communication.
